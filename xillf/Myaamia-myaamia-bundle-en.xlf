Our Waapanahkia ‘Lenape’ (Delaware) grandfathers referred to us as Tuwéhtuwe ‘Twigh Twee.’ This name seems to have been used by Indigenous peoples whose homelands are in what is today Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York.[1] At some point in the past, the Cherokee also used Twigh Twee as a name for our people. In 1820, Meehcikilita ‘Le Gros’ shared a story with C.C. Trowbridge that recounts the origin of the name. In the story, Meehcikilita said Myaamia people “discovered the Cherokees, and were in the habit of making war upon them.” Cherokee homelands include parts of what are today the states of Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama. In this early period of warfare, Myaamia people likely targeted the Overhill Cherokee towns in what is today southeastern Tennessee. In his story, Meehcikilita recounted that the Myaamia had made three successful attacks on those communities before the Cherokee planned a retaliatory attack.</note>
