# Myaamia-Peewaalia Dictionary

This repository contains resources for the Myaamia-Peewaalia dictionary, a collaborative effort between the Miami Nation of Indiana & Oklahoma and Miami University in Ohio. The goal of this project is to assist in the preservation and teaching of the Myaamia language.

## Dictionary

The main dictionary can be found at [https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/dictionary](https://mc.miamioh.edu/ilda-myaamia/dictionary). It is a searchable online dictionary that provides translations between Myaamia and English.

## Resources

This repository includes various resources to aid in Myaamia language learning and collaboration:

- OmegaT: Translation memory files for use with the OmegaT computer-assisted translation tool.
- Pot files: Portable object template files for localization purposes.
- Aspell dictionaries: Dictionary files for use with the Aspell spell checker.

## AI Assistance

We are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to assist in teaching and learning the Myaamia language. By building a Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) file, AI models can be trained to provide more open-ended queries and assistance in language acquisition.
